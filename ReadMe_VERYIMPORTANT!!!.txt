Starting Conditions - Commander Mod Set - Mod by SunRazor1 @Steam, August 21, 2018
The following directory is where the mod file (XML file) needs to go to be recognized by the game: 
C:\Program Files\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stationeers\rocketstation_Data\StreamingAssets\Data
OR
D:\Program Files\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stationeers\rocketstation_Data\StreamingAssets\Data

!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The name of the file is not important, but it is very important that you only have ONE (1) starting conditions xml file in the Data\ folder!!!

Suggestion:
In the Data/ folder, create a new folder named ORIGINAL to store your original startconditions.xml file for safe-keeping.
In the Data/ folder, create a 2nd new folder named MODS to store all your mod xml files to avoid conflicts.

Therefore, BEFORE YOU ADD THE MOD TO YOUR Data\ FOLDER, you must:
1. Move the original startconditions.xml file into a safe folder (in your ORIGINAL\ folder).
2. Extract and keep all starconditions mod files in a different safe folder (in your MODS\ folder).
3. Copy only the mod xml file you want into Data\



========== Mod Features ==========

This Mod is designed to give you the power to be the Commander you always wanted to be!
This Mod was inspired by the need to deprive griefers from their abilities to randomly come into your beautiful world and cause you grief at the [very easy] click of a mouse button. When you start a new world, please take a minute to go through your new Commanders Inventory found in the Command Kit (crate). Each stronger variation of the Commander Mod gives you more power, which also makes the game easier. In addition to the increased level of early-game security, a few extra empty mining belts are provided to help take away some stress. Hope you enjoy!
